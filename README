Overview
========

This is an implementation of the GSS EAP mechanism, as described in
draft-ietf-abfab-gss-eap-00.txt.

Building
========

In order to build this, a recent Kerberos implementation (MIT or
Heimdal), Shibboleth, and EAP libraries are required, along with
all of their dependencies.

Note: not all SPIs are supported by the Heimdal mechanism glue,
so not all features will be available.

Installing
==========

When installing, be sure to edit $prefix/etc/gss/mech to register
the EAP mechanisms. A sample configuration file is in this directory.

Make sure your RADIUS library is configured to talk to the server of
your choice: see the example radsec.conf in this directory.

On the RADIUS server side, you need to install dictionary.ukerna and
include it from the main dictionary file.

If you want the acceptor be able to identify the user, the RADIUS
server needs to echo back the EAP username from the inner tunnel;
for privacy, mech_eap only sends the realm in the EAP Identity
response. To configure this with FreeRADIUS, add:

        update outer.reply {
            User-Name = "%{request:User-Name}"
        }

to $prefix/etc/raddb/sites-enabled/inner-tunnel, and ensure that

    virtual_server = "inner-tunnel"

is set in eap.conf for the desired EAP types.

To test the SAML assertion code path, you can place a fixed SAML
assertion in the update reply block of the default configuration.

        update reply {
            SAML-AAA-Assertion = '<saml:Assertion ...'
            SAML-AAA-Assertion += '...'
        }

You'll need to split it into multiple lines because of the RADIUS
attribute size limit.

Testing
=======

You can then test the MIT or Cyrus GSS and SASL example programs.
Sample usage is given below. Substitute <user>, <pass> and <host>
appropriately (<host> is the name of the host running the server,
not the RADIUS server).

% gss-client -port 5555 -spnego -mech "{1 3 6 1 4 1 5322 22 1 18}" \
  -user <user> -pass <pass> <host> host@<host> "Testing GSS EAP"
% gss-server -port 5555 -export host@<host>

Note: for SASL you will be prompted for a username and password.

% client -C -p 5556 -s host -m EAP-AES128 <host>
% server -c -p 5556 -s host -h <host>
